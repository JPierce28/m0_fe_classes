# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
  - I felt overwhelmed at first, after a short break I came back and was able to accomplish the work. I felt really good doing these tasks and feel very accomplished with how much I've learned.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
  - My workflow today was really great. When I felt I needed a break I took one and when I came back I was fully focused on my work.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
  - It was helpful doing the lesson portion of this with another person. We were able to communicate our ideas as we were learning and provide a different perspective to one another. Once we both felt overwhelmed we went our separate ways to take a break or stay focused the way we new was best for ourselves. I enjoyed this dynamic today.
